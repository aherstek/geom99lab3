      <!-- references: https://www.readersdigest.ca/travel/canada/provincial-flowers-history/ -->
      <div id="Yukon-description" class="province-description">
        <p><strong>Yukon - Fireweed</strong></p>
        <p>Commonly found along roadsides and river bars in the region, the fireweed became Yukon’s floral emblem in 1957. Known for its hardiness, it’s also one of the first plants to appear after forest fires—hence the name.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="NorthwestTerritories-description" class="province-description" style="display: none;">
        <p><strong>Northwest Territories – Mountain Avens</strong></p>
        <p>These pretty plants, which are native to Canada’s western and Arctic regions, became the Northwest Territories’s floral emblem in 1957. While mountain avens are a member of the rose family, they only grow in high, rocky terrain and bloom from June to July.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="Nunavut-description" class="province-description" style="display: none;">
        <p><strong>Nunavut – Purple Saxifrage</strong></p>
        <p>When Nunavut split from the Northwest Territories in 1999, a vast list of new, important decisions needed to be made—including crowning a new floral emblem. The following year, the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut voted unanimously to adopt the lovely purple saxifrage as the territory’s official flower.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="BritishColumbia-description" class="province-description" style="display: none;">
        <p><strong>British Columbia – Pacific Dogwood</strong></p>
        <p>The instantly recognizable Pacific dogwood technically isn’t a flower, but a tree! Native to the southwest region of the province, it became British Columbia’s floral emblem in 1956. Unfortunately, this species has long been a target of anthracnose, a fungal disease which has caused a decline in dogwood in recent years as a result.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="Alberta-description" class="province-description" style="display: none;">
        <p><strong>Alberta – Wild Rose</strong></p>
        <p>Alberta is one of three provinces to have left the selection of its provincial flower to schoolchildren. Though it grows across Canada, the wild rose was officially adopted to symbolize Alberta’s diversity, history, and landscape after its youngsters voted for it in 1930.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="Saskatchewan-description" class="province-description" style="display: none;">
        <p><strong>Saskatchewan – Western Red Lily</strong></p>
        <p>Thanks to the Saskatchewan Natural History Society, the western red lily became the province’s floral emblem in 1941. Twenty-eight years later, it gained a boost in popularity when it was chosen to appear on Saskatchewan’s flag. (Anthony Drake, a schoolteacher who was originally from the United Kingdom, was responsible for the design.)</p>
      </div>
      <div id="Manitoba-description" class="province-description" style="display: none;">
        <p><strong>Manitoba – Prairie Crocus</strong></p>
        <p>This lovely lavender flower is one of the oldest provincial flowers: it was selected by schoolchildren in a province-wide vote in 1906.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="Ontario-description" class="province-description" style="display: none;">
        <p><strong>Ontario – White Trillium</strong></p>
        <p>Unlike other provincial flowers of Canada, Ontario’s floral emblem is rooted in tragedy: after the First World War, a committee chose the white trillium to be planted on the graves of Canadian servicemen buried overseas. It was not until 1937, however, that the white trillium was adopted as Ontario’s floral emblem.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="Quebec-description" class="province-description" style="display: none;">
        <p><strong>Quebec – Blue Flag</strong></p>
        <p>For 36 years, Quebec’s floral emblem was the Madonna lily; to many, it resembled the fleur-de-lis on Quebec’s—and France’s—flag. There was just one problem: the Madonna lily doesn’t grow in Quebec and, as a result, the province officially chose the native Blue Flag as the Madonna lily’s replacement in 1999.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="NewBrunswick-description" class="province-description" style="display: none;">
        <p><strong>New Brunswick – Purple Violet</strong></p>
        <p>The striking Purple Violet became New Brunswick’s official flower in 1936, thanks to input from the Women’s Institute, the Lieutenant Governor, and the province’s schoolchildren.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="NovaScotia-description" class="province-description" style="display: none;">
        <p><strong>Nova Scotia – Mayflower</strong></p>
        <p>Declared Nova Scotia’s floral emblem in 1901, the mayflower is the oldest provincial flower in Canada. Its association with the province dates back even further, however: the mayflower was first used as a decorative motif on the front page of The Nova Scotian in 1825.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="PrinceEdwardIsland-description" class="province-description" style="display: none;">
        <p><strong>Prince Edward Island – Lady’s Slipper</strong></p>
        <p>The lady’s slipper, a botanical cousin of the orchid, has 12 species, three of which are found in Prince Edward Island. (The hardest to find is yellow, with pink being the most common.) It became the province’s floral emblem in 1947.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="NewfoundlandAndLabrador-description" class="province-description" style="display: none;">
        <p><strong>Newfoundland and Labrador – Purple Pitcher Plant</strong></p>
        <p>Of all the provincial flowers of Canada, Newfoundland and Labrador’s is unique in that it’s carnivorous! Native to the region, the purple pitcher plant was chosen by Queen Victoria to appear on the newly created Newfoundland penny in 1863. It was officially made the floral emblem in 1954.</p>

     <div id="subtitle">But... what determines where each flower grows? Climate!</div>
    <div id="description">
      <p>Canada has a diverse range of climate zones, each significantly impacting the flowers that grow within them. In the southern regions, a temperate climate allows for very diverse vegetation, such as deciduous and coniferous trees and exotic flowers. Moving northwards, Canada transitions into subarctic and arctic climates, where harsh, weather conditions occur. In these regions, only specialized plants adapted to extreme cold, such as mosses, lichens, and hardy shrubs, can survive. Coastal areas have milder temperatures due to oceanic influences, allowing unique ecosystems like temperate rainforests and marshes. </p>
