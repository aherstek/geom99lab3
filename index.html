    <div id="title">Canada's Provincial Flowers</div>
    <div id="subtitle">Lets learn about the provinicial flowers of Canada's provinces and territories!</div>
    <div id="description">
      <p>Unique flower emblems represent the Canadian provinces and territories. These symbols represent the sovereignty and the various provincial identities. They express the different features of a province or territory. The provincial floral symbols account for the flora of an area.</p>
    <br>
      <p><strong>Yukon - Fireweed</strong></p>
        <p>Commonly found along roadsides and river bars in the region, the fireweed became Yukon’s floral emblem in 1957. Known for its hardiness, it’s also one of the first plants to appear after forest fires—hence the name.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Northwest Territories – Mountain Avens</strong></p>
        <p>These pretty plants, which are native to Canada’s western and Arctic regions, became the Northwest Territories’s floral emblem in 1957. While mountain avens are a member of the rose family, they only grow in high, rocky terrain and bloom from June to July.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Nunavut – Purple Saxifrage</strong></p>
        <p>When Nunavut split from the Northwest Territories in 1999, a vast list of new, important decisions needed to be made—including crowning a new floral emblem. The following year, the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut voted unanimously to adopt the lovely purple saxifrage as the territory’s official flower. (It’s also featured on Nunavut’s coat of arms.)</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>British Columbia – Pacific Dogwood</strong></p>
        <p>The instantly recognizable Pacific dogwood technically isn’t a flower, but a tree! Native to the southwest region of the province, it became British Columbia’s floral emblem in 1956. Unfortunately, this pretty species has long been a target of anthracnose, a fungal disease—the Pacific dogwood has declined in numbers in recent years as a result.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Alberta – Wild Rose</strong></p>
        <p>Alberta is one of three provinces to have left the selection of its provincial flower to schoolchildren. Though it grows across Canada, the wild rose was officially adopted to symbolize Alberta’s diversity, history and landscape after its youngsters voted for it in 1930.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Saskatchewan – Western Red Lily</strong></p>
        <p>Thanks to the Saskatchewan Natural History Society, the western red lily became the province’s floral emblem in 1941. Twenty-eight years later, it gained a boost in popularity when it was chosen to appear on Saskatchewan’s flag. (Anthony Drake, a schoolteacher who was originally from the United Kingdom, was responsible for the design.)</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Manitoba – Prairie Crocus</strong></p>
        <p>This lovely lavender flower is one of the oldest provincial flowers: it was selected by schoolchildren in a province-wide vote in 1906.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Ontario – White Trillium</strong></p>
        <p>Unlike other provincial flowers of Canada, Ontario’s floral emblem is rooted in tragedy: after the First World War, a committee chose the white trillium to be planted on the graves of Canadian servicemen buried overseas. It was not until 1937, however, that the white trillium was adopted as Ontario’s floral emblem.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Quebec – Blue Flag</strong></p>
        <p>For 36 years, Quebec’s floral emblem was the Madonna lily; to many, it resembled the fleur-de-lis on Quebec’s—and France’s—flag. There was just one problem: the Madonna lily doesn’t grown in Quebec and, as a result, a botanist named Jacques Rousseau began to advocate for a new emblem. In 1999, the province officially chose the native Blue Flag as the Madonna lily’s replacement.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>New Brunswick – Purple Violet</strong></p>
        <p>The striking Purple Violet became New Brunswick’s official flower in 1936, thanks to input from the Women’s Institute, the Lieutenant Governor and the province’s schoolchildren.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Nova Scotia – Mayflower</strong></p>
        <p>Declared Nova Scotia’s floral emblem in 1901, the mayflower is the oldest provincial flower in Canada. Its association with the province dates back even further, however: the mayflower was first used as a decorative motif on the front page of The Nova Scotian in 1825.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Prince Edward Island – Lady’s Slipper</strong></p>
        <p>The lady’s slipper, a botanical cousin of the orchid, has 12 species, three of which are found in Prince Edward Island. (The hardest to find is yellow, with pink being the most common.) It became the province’s floral emblem in 1947.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Newfoundland and Labrador – Purple Pitcher Plant</strong></p>
        <p>Of all the provincial flowers of Canada, Newfoundland and Labrador’s is unique in that it’s carnivorous! Native to the region, the purple pitcher plant was chosen by Queen Victoria to appear on the newly created Newfoundland penny in 1863. It was officially made the floral emblem in 1954, shortly after the province joined the Confederation.</p>
